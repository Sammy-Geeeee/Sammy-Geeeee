Hi, Iâ€™m @Sammy-Geeeee (Sam). I live in Auckland, New Zealand.  
I am currently working as a Mechanical Engineer.  
  
I'd like to make the switch to a more software and development related field, and am building a portfolio of projects here.  
I am learning how to code in Python and a little bit of C#.

Most of the projects I have made here are either Mechanical Engineering related or random ideas/proofs of concepts that I wanted to try out.

You can reach me through my email: Sam.Givan@outlook.com
