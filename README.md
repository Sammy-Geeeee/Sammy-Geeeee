- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sammy-Geeeee (Sam). I live in Auckland, New Zealand and am currently working as a Mechanical Engineer.  

- I'm interested in machine learning and big data algorithims. Any type of software automation is also very interesting. 
  I'd like to make the switch to a more software and development related field, but don't know enough to do so yet.  
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python from Al Sweigart's book "Automate the Boring Stuff' and Amit Saha's "Doing Math With Python".  
  Coming from an Engineering background I have especially enjoyed doing math with Python as we learnt how to do all of this by hand at uni and I didn't know it was this simple to program a computer to do it for you.  
  I would also like to learn how to code in C#, as it shows up a lot in the job listings I see.
