Hi, Iâ€™m @Sammy-Geeeee (Sam). I live in Perth, Australia.    
I am currently working as a Consultant Engineer in the Vibration, Dynamics, and Noise space, focusing on Rotating Equipment Reliability. 
  
I am learning how to code in Python and a little bit of C#.     
Most of the projects I have made here are either Engineering related or random ideas/proofs of concepts that I wanted to try out.    
  
You can reach me through my email: Sam.Givan@outlook.com
