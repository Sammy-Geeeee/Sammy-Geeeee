- Hi, I’m @Sammy-Geeeee (Sam). I live in Auckland, New Zealand.  
  I am currently working as a Mechanical Engineer.  

- I'm interested in Machine Learning and Data Analysis.  
  Any type of Software based Automation is also very interesting to me, whether you're automating boring tasks at work or automating the functions of an entire factory.  
  I'd like to make the switch to a more software and development related field, and am slowly building a portfolio of projects here.  
  
- I’m currently learning about Algorithms in Python from Bradfor Tuckfield's 'Dive into Algorithms book.
  I've also previously read Al Sweigart's book "Automate the Boring Stuff' and Amit Saha's "Doing Math With Python".  
  Coming from an Engineering background I have especially enjoyed doing math with Python as we learnt how to do all of this by hand at uni and I didn't know it was this simple to program a computer to do it for you.  
  I would also like to learn how to code in C# and learn about SQL databases, as it shows up a lot in the job listings I see.
