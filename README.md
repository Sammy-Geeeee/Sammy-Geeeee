Hi, Iâ€™m @Sammy-Geeeee (Sam). I live in Auckland, New Zealand.  
I am currently working as a Mechanical Engineer.  
  
I'd like to make the switch to a more software and development related field, and am building a portfolio of projects here.  
I am learning how to code in C# and Python, and learning about SQL databases as well.
  
Coming from an Engineering background I have especially enjoyed learning how to program mathematical functions. I learnt how to do all of this by hand at Uni and High School, and heve enojoyed being able to implement this into programs.
